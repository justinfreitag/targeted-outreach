# Targeted Outreach

You are not alone. The archive begins here.

This is the front door to a deeper system of documentation and symbolic exposure.

The **Disruption Field Codex** is a living archive of observed neuro-sensory, symbolic, and environmental manipulation tactics used to shape perception, behavior, and belief.

It is not a guide.  
It is a record. A mirror. A defense.

## Link to the Codex

## Defense Layer

The codex now includes a full symbolic defense layerâ€”strategies, rituals, and recovery practices designed to help individuals reclaim their perception, emotional sovereignty, and symbolic boundary integrity.

These documents are intended for:
- Those experiencing or recovering from prolonged symbolic or neuro-sensory disruption
- Those observing these tactics in others and seeking understanding
- Anyone trying to name and recognize the field at work
